#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// Consider the case where we want to show the user a menu and ask them to make a selection -- and if the user chooses an invalid selection, to ask them again.
	// Clearly the menu and selection should go inside a loop of some kind (so we can keep asking the user until they enter valid input), but what kind of loop should we choose?

	// Since a while loop evaluates the condition up front, it’s an awkward choice. We could solve the issue like this:
	{
		// selection must be declared outside while loop so we can use it later
		int selection{ 0 };

		while (selection != 1 && selection != 2 && selection != 3 && selection != 4)
		{
			std::cout << "PLease make a selection: " << '\n';
			std::cout << "1) Addition" << '\n';
			std::cout << "2) Subtraction" << '\n';
			std::cout << "3) Multiplication" << '\n';
			std::cout << "4) Division" << '\n';
			std::cin >> selection;
		}

		// do something with selection here
		// such as a switch statement

		std::cout << "your selection option: #" << selection << '.' << '\n';
	}
	std::cout << std::string(50, '-') << '\n';

	// But this only works because our initial value of 0 for selection isn’t in the set of valid values (1, 2, 3 or 4).
	// What if 0 was a valid choice? We’d have to pick a different initializer to represent “invalid” -- and now we’re introducing magic numbers into our code.

	// We could instead add a new variable to track validity, like so:
	
	{
		int selection{ 0 };
		bool invalid{ true }; // new variable just to gate the loop

		while (invalid)
		{
			std::cout << "Please make a selection: \n";
			std::cout << "1) Addition\n";
			std::cout << "2) Subtraction\n";
			std::cout << "3) Multiplication\n";
			std::cout << "4) Division\n";

			std::cin >> selection;
			invalid = (selection != 1 && selection != 2 &&
				selection != 3 && selection != 4);
		}

		// do something with selection here
		// such as a switch statement

		std::cout << "You selected option #" << selection << '\n';
	}
	std::cout << std::string(50, '-') << '\n';

	// While this avoids the magic number, it introduces a new variable just to ensure the loop runs once, and that adds complexity and the possibility of additional errors.

	//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	// Do while statements

	// To help solve problems like the above, C++ offers the do-while statement:
	// A do while statement is a looping construct that works just like a while loop, except the statement always executes at least once.
	// After the statement has been executed, the do-while loop checks the condition.
	// If the condition evaluates to true, the path of execution jumps back to the top of the do-while loop and executes it again.

	// Here is our example above using a do-while loop instead of a while loop:
	{
		// selection must be declared outside of the do-while so we can use it later
		int selection{};

		do
		{
			std::cout << "PLease make a selection: " << '\n';
			std::cout << "1) Addition" << '\n';
			std::cout << "2) Subtraction" << '\n';
			std::cout << "3) Multiplication" << '\n';
			std::cout << "4) Division" << '\n';
			std::cin >> selection;
		}
		while (selection != 1 && selection != 2 && selection != 3 && selection != 4);

		// do something with selection here
		// such as a switch statement

		std::cout << "your selection option: #" << selection << '.' << '\n';
	}
	std::cout << std::string(50, '-') << '\n';

	// In practice, do-while loops aren’t commonly used. 
	// Having the condition at the bottom of the loop obscures the loop condition, which can lead to errors.
	// Many developers recommend avoiding do-while loops altogether as a result. 
	// We’ll take a softer stance and advocate for preferring while loops over do-while when given an equal choice.

	return 0;
